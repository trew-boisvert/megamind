game start
4 digit number code gotten from API (maybe longer or shorter depending on level)
on loop
    player can see history of guesses and feedback and remaining turns
    player guesses combo
        check if win, end game
            offer replay
        feedback on:
            if a number is correct or if number and digit is correct
            if whole guess was wrong
            add to guess counter
            ten guesses ends the game 
                offer replay

extras:
    allow for replay
    allow choice in length of code/ change difficulty
        allow choice to change difficulty between replays?
    track scores across games
    hint mode:
        correct guess of number and location is revealed (---- => --3-)
        written hint about number not in code
        written hint about correct number, but not location
                
think about:
    don't make it recursive in the replays
    handling incorrect input (wrong chars, length)
    what if the api doesn't respond?
    modular code, make it pretty

test cases (2025)
    all incorrect (1346)
    one correct, wrong location (0789)
    one correct, correct location (2469)
    guessed same correct number twice, should only say correct once (0790)
    guessed correct number there is 2 of, should say correct once (9287)
    three correct, two correct location (2092)
    ten wrong guesses, game over
    ten guesses, last one all correct, game win
    win in under 10 guesses
